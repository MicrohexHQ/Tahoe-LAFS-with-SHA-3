\section{Cryptographic Hash Functions}

A cryptographic hash function is a deterministic mathematical procedure which
takes an arbitrary block of data and outputs a fixed-size bit string. The output
is referred to as the hash value, message digest or simply digest.
Another property of a cryptographic hash function is that the smallest change in
the input data (e.g. one bit) should completely change the output of the hash
function. In other words it should be infeasible to find the reverse of a
cryptographic hash function \cite[p. 335]{stallings}. It should also be infeasible to
find two blocks of data which produce the same hash value (a \emph{collision}).

\subsection{NIST SHA-3 Competition}
The \ac{SHA} version 3 is a coming standard set to supersede the current
standards that the \ac{SHA}-1 and the \ac{SHA}-2 family has become. The hash
function that will be known as \ac{SHA}-3 will be decided by the \ac{NIST} and
chosen between the submitted contestants to the \ac{NIST} hash competition.
At the time of writing, the current status of the competition is officially
called Round 2, with 14 of 64 candidates having ``survived'' Round 1
\cite{s_fedreg}.

\subsubsection{\ac{NIST} evaluation criteria for \ac{SHA}-3}

\label{sec:lengthextension}
\paragraph{Security.} The most important criteria for the SHA-3
candidates\cite{s_nistround2} is security. The full description of security
criteria are mentioned in \cite{s_fedreg}, however the most noteworthy criterion
in regards to Tahoe-\ac{LAFS} is that \ac{SHA}-3 candidates are required to have
resistance against length-extension attacks. Both \ac{SHA}-1 and the \ac{SHA}-2
family are vulnerable to this kind of attack, and thus requires
Tahoe to run the algorithm twice, as described by \citet{schneier}.

\paragraph{Cost and Performance.} Cost and Performance are considered to be the
2nd most important criterion. The absolute minimum for performance is that the
SHA-3 candidate should be faster than the functions in the \ac{SHA}-2 family.
Cost is a measure of how much memory an implementation requires in software,
both the implementation itself and the use of \ac{RAM} during runtime. Another
measure of cost is how many logic gates it takes to implement the function in
hardware.

\paragraph{Algorithm and implementation characteristics.} By this 3rd criteria,
\ac{NIST} emphasizes that algorithms with greater flexibility will be given
preference over other algorithms \cite{s_nistround2}. By flexible, they imply
the possibility of the function to run efficiently on a variety of platforms,
and to use parallelism and instruction set extensions. Another key point of a
flexible hash function is that it should have a simple and elegant design to
encourage understanding, analysis and design confidence.

\subsubsection{\ac{NIST} \ac{SHA}-3 \ac{API}}
\ac{NIST} required that every submission conform to a specified
\ac{API}\cite{s_fedreg}. The \ac{API} is specified at \cite{s_nistapi} and in
shortness it requires every candidate to implement four functions.

\begin{verbatim}
HashReturn Init(hashState *state, int hashbitlen);
HashReturn Update(hashState *state, const BitSequence *data, 
    DataLength databitlen);
HashReturn Final(hashState *state, BitSequence *hashval);
HashReturn Hash(int hashbitlen, const BitSequence *data, 
    DataLength databitlen, BitSequence *hashval);
\end{verbatim}

The Init() function basically sets up the internal state of the function, to
make it ready to start processing real data. The Update() function is used to
provide the actuall data to the hash function. The Final() function should be
called when all necessary data has been gived through Update(), it will then
finish the hash function and provide the digest. The Hash() function basically a wrapper
for doing a call to the three other functions.

HashReturn is an enum representing that an operation either succeded (0) or
went wrong. The BitSequence is a representation of an array of bytefields and
DataLength represents the size in bits of the data provided.

\subsection{\ac{SUPERCOP}}
% TODO: Mention that some SUPERCOP candidates are missing UPDATE-functionality.
\ac{SUPERCOP} is a toolkit developed by VAMPIRE lab for measuring performance
of cryptographic software \cite{s_supercop}. In relation to hash functions
\ac{SUPERCOP} measures the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Time to hash a very short packet of data.
    \item Time to hash a typical-size Internet packet.
    \item Time to hash a long message.
    \item Length of the hash output.
\end{itemize}

The Round 2 \ac{SHA}-3 candidates are all included in the toolkit, with a number
of different optimizations for each candidate. Optimizations range from
32-/64-bit specific implementations, the use of extended instruction sets such
as \ac{SSE2} and \ac{SSSE3}, optimizations for different number of cores and
others. The toolkit will also try different compiler optimizations to get the
best results possible for each function.
% TODO: Insert image to visualize the forest of different implementations.

The benchmarking results for the \ac{SUPERCOP} toolkit of the \ac{SHA}-3
candidates and \ac{SHA}-2 functions on a number of different plattforms and
architectures are available at
\footnote{\url{http://bench.cr.yp.to/results-sha3.html}}
% TODO: Link to appendix with tahoe04 SUPERCOP results.

\subsubsection{\ac{SUPERCOP} \ac{API}}
\ac{SUPERCOP} specifies an \ac{API} which all submitted implementations must
conform to\cite{s_supercopapi}. This \ac{API} specifies the naming and
organization of files, and that a submission must include a function
crypto\_hash() which is similar to the function Hash() in the \ac{NIST} \ac{SHA}-3
\ac{API}. The only difference beeing the naming of datatypes and that the
crypto\_hash() function does not need an input of how long the output of the
hash function should be. Instead double or different submissions are used for
different output lengths.

\begin{verbatim}
int crypto_hash(unsigned char *out, const unsigned char *in,
    unsigned long long inlen)
\end{verbatim}

\section{Tahoe-LAFS}
%What is it, how/where are hash functions used, Python, pycryptopp
%comparison with RAID-6, mutable/immutable?

The Tahoe \ac{LAFS} is a system for secure,
distributed data storage. Files are encrypted client side, then
split up, before each part is sent to other nodes in the grid, as depicted in
figure \ref{fig:tahoeinsertion}. The integrity and confidentiality of the files
are guaranteed by the algorithms used on the client, and is independent of the
storage servers, which may be operated by untrusted people. This is defined as
\emph{provider-independent security} \cite{t_tahoe}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{Tahoe-newfile.pdf}
    \caption{Tahoe-LAFS: Insertion of new file}
    \label{fig:tahoeinsertion}
\end{figure}

Tahoe was originally developed with funding from the former commercial web
backup service provider Allmydata, but is now a stand-alone Open
Source\footnote{GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2} project
\cite{t_ars}.  It is written in the Python programming language with the Twisted
framework, and can run on Windows, Mac OSX, Linux, Solaris and more.

\subsection{Architecture}

Tahoe has a three layer architecture: the key-value store, the filesystem, and
the application \cite{t_tahoe}.

The \textbf{key-value store}, or the ``capability-data bytes'' store, is the
lowest layer and is implemented by a grid of Tahoe-LAFS storage servers. Data is
kept on the storage servers in the form of ``shares'', which are encrypted and
encoded parts of files. Capabilities are short ASCII strings, containing
information on where to \emph{find} a file, and how to \emph{verify} it.
Nodes in the grid learn about each other through an ``introducer'', which
roughly relates to a tracker in the BitTorrent\footnote{See
\url{http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep\_0003.html}} protocol.

The \textbf{filesystem} layer is responsible for mapping human-meaningful
pathnames to pieces of data. Each directory contains a table of capabilities
for its children, i.e. subdirectories or files. Two forms of capabilities is
available for each file, read-only and read-write, and these can be shared to
provide shared/published directory structures with friends.

Since it is not practical for users to remember strings containing random
characters, the \textbf{application} layer is used for providing a user-friendly
interface to the directories and files.

\paragraph{File types.}

There are two kinds of files in the Tahoe-\ac{LAFS} -- \textbf{immutable} and
\textbf{mutable} files. An immutable file is created exactly once, i.e. it
cannot be modified, and can be read repeatedly. Mutable files can be modified,
and everyone who has access to the \emph{signing key} can make new versions of
the mutable file.
%More text here?

\paragraph{Erasure coding.}

When a client puts a file on the grid, it first encrypts the file, before
breaking the file into small segments. The segments are then \emph{erasure
coded}.  The use of the Solomon-Reed erasure coding scheme, enables Tahoe to
recover a file using only a predefined subset of the parts distributed to the
storage servers, i.e. the other nodes in the grid. Erasure coding is a type of
\ac{FEC} code, which extends a message with $C$ characters into a longer message
with $N$ symbols \cite{t_reed-solomon}.  The original $C$ characters can then be
recovered from a subset of the $N$ symbols.

The properties of erasure coding can be thought of as those of replication in
\acsu{RAID} systems. \citet*{t_erasure} compare erasure coding and plain
replication, and conclude that ``\emph{...  erasure codes have mean time to
failures many orders of magnitude higher than replicated systems with similar
storage and bandwidth requirements.}''

\subsection{Use of secure hashes in Tahoe-LAFS}

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{Tahoe-hashes.pdf}
    \caption{Tahoe-LAFS: Example of hashing operations.}
    \label{fig:tahoehashing}
    \emph{Figure based on
     \href{http://tahoe-lafs.org/source/tahoe/trunk/docs/specifications/CHK-hashes.svg}
     {CHK-hashes.svg from Tahoe-LAFS documentation}}
     %TODO: Footnote with full URL using footnotemark
\end{figure}

As seen in figure \ref{fig:tahoehashing}, the usage of secure hashing is
extensive in Tahoe, and has to be considered as a key part of the functionality,
and thus affecting the performance.

\paragraph{Hash Trees.}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{Tahoe-MerkleTree.pdf}
    \caption{Example of a Merkle tree.}
    \label{fig:tahoemerkletree}
\end{figure}

A hash tree, also known as a \emph{Merkle tree}, is a type of data structure
which can be described as a tree with nodes that can verify all information
below in the hierarchy, as depicted in figure \ref{fig:tahoemerkletree}. This
enables Tahoe to verify small segments of a file at the time, and this can be
used for instance to start playing a movie file while it is still being
downloaded.

These secure hashes of the shares of a file, are contained within a small
datastructure named the \emph{\ac{CEB}}.

\paragraph{Capabilities.}

A \textbf{capability} (or an URI) contains the encryption key, and a hash of the
\emph{\ac{UEB}}. The \ac{UEB} for each file is a data structure containing the
hash of the \ac{CEB}, the size of the file, any encoding parameters necessary to
perform the erasure decoding, and a hash of the plaintext and the encrypted
text. This is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:tahoeueb}.

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{Tahoe-UEB.pdf}
    \caption{The composition of an \ac{UEB}.}
    \label{fig:tahoeueb}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Storage Index.}

A hash of the encryption key is used to form the "storage index", which is
used for both server selection and to index shares within each storage node.

\section{Python and Cython}
%What is it, how, why, alternatives?
% TODO: Finn en kilde pÃ¥ pythonting, om det trengs?
Python\footnote{\url{http://www.python.org}} is a high-level general-purpose
programming language. Python is also an interpreted language, which means that
python programs are compiled at runtime.  There exists multiple implementations
of Python, however the most common, CPython, is implemented in C. The fact that
Python is a high-level language usually means that there is performance penalty
in contrast with lower level languages, shuch as C. To remedy this problem it
is possible to write extensions to the language by using the official C-API.
This approach has been used by several cryptographic libraries for python such
as the official hashlib\footnote{\url{http://code.krypto.org/python/hashlib/}}
and pycryptopp\footnote{\url{http://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/pycryptopp}}.

Tahoe-\ac{LAFS} is written in python, but the SHA-3 candidate implementations found
in both the official NIST submissions and supercop are either in C or in
assembly. Therefore it is necessary to either implement the functions in python
or make extensions to python through the C-API. Where extensions should give
the best performance. % TODO: KILDE? 

\subsection{Cython}
Cython\footnote{\url{http://www.cython.org}} is a language for writing Python
extensions in a language that closely resembles the Python language itself.
Basically what Cython does is to parse Cython files and generate C source files
that utilises the Python C-API. Afterwards the generated source files can be
compiled as if they were written directly in C. A small performance trade-off is
to be expected from this, due to the extra layer of abstraction.

% TODO: Mer intro

\section{Choosing implementations of the SHA-3 Candidates}

While the official \ac{NIST} \ac{SHA}-3 second round submissions contain both
a reference version and optimized versions of the candidates, it does not
appear to be updated since the submission deadline on September 15, 2009. They
also do not contain any benchmarking utility which could be used to decide on
the best implementation for a particular platform or architecture. \ac{SUPERCOP}
on the other hand, provides both, in combination with results stating which
compiler arguments gives the best performance. On the downside, the
\ac{SUPERCOP} \ac{API} only specifies the \texttt{crypto\_hash()} function and
not an \texttt{update()} function which Tahoe-\ac{LAFS} is dependent on using.

Since Tahoe-\ac{LAFS} is using \ac{SHA}-256 internally, we only test \ac{SHA}-3
functions with 256-bit output in our implementation. 


\subsection{Criteria for implementation selection}

We chose the fastest implementation of each candidate that conforms to the
following criteria:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The implementation must have an \ac{API} defined in C.
  \item The implementation must include a working \verb update() function.
  \item The implementation must not use assembly that can not be made
    position independent by \ac{GCC}.
  \item The implementation should conform to the \acp{KAT} specified in the
    \ac{NIST} submission package, or later updates by the author.
\end{enumerate}

% TODO fix kilde
Based on these criteria, we choose the fastest possible implementation based
on our benchmark in \ac{SUPERCOP}. The relative speed of each implementation, in
relation to other implementation for the same and other candidates are
available at source.

\subsection{Chosen implementations}

\input{tables/sha3_implementations}

The chosen implementations are shown in Table \ref{tbl:sha3:implementations}
and their compiler flags used, which are extracted from the \ac{SUPERCOP}
results can be seen in Table\ref{tbl:sha3:compilerflags}. It should be noted
that 32 in blake32 does not refer to the output length of the function, but the
fact that the algorithm is optimized for 32-bit usage. 512 in Keccackc512 also
does not mean 512-bit output, but 512 cycles in the internal function. The
relative speeds of the implementations chosen compared to the best version in
\ac{SUPERCOP} and relative speed of the benchmark compared to other candidates
can bee seen in Table \ref{tbl:sha3:speedrelative}. It should also be noted
that the fastest sha256 implementation in \ac{SUPERCOP} is
cryptopp\footnote{\url{http://www.cryptopp.com/}}, which is the one used by
Tahoe-\ac{LAFS}. For the most part we have found working versions of all
candidates in \ac{SUPERCOP}, however there are some exceptions. 

\input{tables/sha3_flags}

\input{tables/sha3_relativespeed}

\paragraph{JH} seems to be broken in every implementation with regard to
criteria 2. For both the optimized versions found in \ac{SUPERCOP} and the
reference implementations in the \ac{NIST} submission package, Hash("foofoo")
will not yield the same result as two consecutive calls to Update("foo").
However the implementation in sphlib does fulfill this requirement. We have
also contacted the author, Thomas Pornin, which confirms this problem with the
official JH candidate and that the author has been made aware of the problem
but has not released any updated version yet.
% TODO: Fix hvordan vi referer til e-post?

\paragraph{Cubehash} sadly does not have a version in \ac{SUPERCOP} with a 256-bit
output, which is why we have only included a version from sphlib.

\paragraph{Simd vect128 implementation} does not by default conform to
criteria 4, because of a bug in the implementation. This has confirmed by the
author who also supplied us with a patch to correct the bug.

\paragraph{Blake32 \ac{SSSE3}} implementation also fail to wholly fulfill
criteria 4, however it does validate all test vectors that have a length 
in bits which is a multiple of 8. Since our python wrappers only allow, and
only need, to provide data in full bytes we decided to keep this
implementation.

\paragraph{Shavite3} seems to have received an update\footnote{see
\url{http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~orrd/SHAvite-3/}}. We have observed that
implementations of Shavite3 in \ac{SUPERCOP}-20101014 or later seems to fail to
verify the \ac{KAT}s, while the version we have used does. We believe this is
only because newer \ac{KAT}s will have to be generated, but since the author
has not done so we chose to use an older version of the algorithm.

% TODO: Add some lines that give reasons for the criteria above.

% sphlib, SUPERCOP, NIST

\section{Python bindings}

Since Tahoe-\ac{LAFS} is written in Python, we needed some way of interacting
with the C implementations of the NIST candidates.

\subsection{Unit tests}
% Include the use of Known Answer Tests

\section{Modifications in the Tahoe-\ac{LAFS} Code}

The code of Tahoe-LAFS conforms to the style guide of Python, known as PEP 8.
This, along with the code being highly modular, emphasizes code readability.
With some experience using Python, it is not difficult to learn the Tahoe code
enough to understand what is happening when a file is uploaded or downloaded
with the system.

All hashing operations requested by the Tahoe system is routed through a
couple of classes and functions, and the connection to the underlying hash
function library is made on only one line. This is displayed in Listing
\ref{lst:hashutil}.

\begin{lstlisting}[label=lst:hashutil, caption=Extract from hashutil.py of Tahoe-LAFS source.]
from pycryptopp.hash.sha256 import SHA256
...
class _SHA256d_Hasher:
    ...
    def __init__(self, truncate_to=None):
        self.h = SHA256()
        self.truncate_to = truncate_to
        self._digest = None

    def update(self, data):
        assert isinstance(data, str) # no unicode
        self.h.update(data)

    def digest(self):
        if self._digest is None:
            h1 = self.h.digest()
            del self.h
            h2 = SHA256(h1).digest()
            if self.truncate_to:
                h1 = h1[:self.truncate_to]
                h2 = h2[:self.truncate_to]
            self._digest = h2

        return self._digest
\end{lstlisting}

As stated in Section \ref{sec:lengthextension}, none of the SHA-3 candidates is
vulnerable to the length-extension attack. Since we are interested in finding
out how Tahoe-\ac{LAFS} performs when utilizing the SHA-3 functions, we can
remove the lines that fixes the length-extension problems manually. In addition,
to try out one of the new implementations, we change line one in Listing
\ref{lst:hashutil}, and the result can be seen in Listing \ref{lst:hashutilmod}.

\begin{lstlisting}[label=lst:hashutilmod, caption=Relevant parts of hashutil.py of Tahoe-LAFS source after modification.]
from sha3lib import bmw256 as SHA256
...
class _SHA256d_Hasher:
    ...
    def __init__(self, truncate_to=None):
        self.h = SHA256()
        self.truncate_to = truncate_to
        self._digest = None

    def update(self, data):
        assert isinstance(data, str) # no unicode
        self.h.update(data)

    def digest(self):
        if self._digest is None:
            h1 = self.h.digest()
            del self.h
            if self.truncate_to:
                h1 = h1[:self.truncate_to]
            self._digest = h1

        return self._digest
\end{lstlisting}

Some notes has to be made regarding the first line in Listing
\ref{lst:hashutilmod}. For every candidate we test, the whole setup and grid is
started from ground up, since changing the hash function this way cause a
backwards compatibility break, making it impossible to download files put to the
grid while using another hash function.
For the same reasons, some of the built-in unit tests of Tahoe-LAFS fail when
changing this line, because they contain test fixtures made with SHA-256.
This also renders uploading of mutable files impossible, since the internal
verification fails. For this reason, \emph{only immutable files} are tested and
measured in this paper.
