\section{Cryptographic Hash Functions}
A Cryptographic Hash function is a deterministic mathematical procedure which
takes an arbritary block of data and outputs a fixed-size bit string. The
output is refered to as the hash value, message digest or simply digest.
Another property of a cryptographic hash function is that a small change in the
input data (just 1 bit) should completly change the output of the hash
function. In other words it should be infeasible to find the reverse of a
cryptographic hash function. It should also be infeasible to find two blocks of
data which produce the same hash value (a collision).

\subsection{NIST SHA-3 Competition}
% Hash functions, NIST Comptetition, Candidates, SuperCop?
The Secure Hash Function version 3 (SHA-3) is a comming standard cryptographic
hash function set to replace the current standards SHA-1 and SHA-2.
It will be selected from a competition held by the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The competition started in 2006
with submission deadline for candidates at the end of 2008. 51 candidates made
it into round 1, however just 14 passed to the second round. The reason for not
passing round 1 are either design weaknesses, substantial cryptographic
weaknesses or performance issues. The winner is sceduled to be selected by the 
2nd quarter of 2012.

The submissions for the various rounds of the SHA-3 competition include
reference implementations, optimized implementations, test-vectors to verify
implementations and documentations explaining the submission.

\subsection{SuperCop}
Supercop is a toolkit developed by VAMPIRE lab for measuring performance of
cryptographic software, among them the SHA-3 candidates. While security is a
primary goal of a hash function, performance can not be neglected if the hash
function should be taken into use. The difference between the implementations
in the official submissions and in supercop is first that the supercop
implementation are continiously updated and that there are more specific
hardwareimplementations available in supercop.

Results by the supercop are published at (URL).

\section{Tahoe-LAFS}
%What is it, how/where are hash functions used, Python, pycryptopp
%comparison with RAID-6, mutable/immutable?

The Tahoe \ac{LAFS} is a system for secure,
distributed data storage. Files are encrypted client side, then
split up, before each part is sent to other nodes in the grid, as depicted in
figure \ref{fig:tahoeinsertion}. The integrity and confidentiality of the files
are guaranteed by the algorithms used on the client, and is independent of the
storage servers, which may be operated by untrusted people. This is defined as
\emph{provider-independent security} \cite{t_tahoe}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{Tahoe-newfile.pdf}
    \caption{Tahoe-LAFS: Insertion of new file}
    \label{fig:tahoeinsertion}
\end{figure}

Tahoe was originally developed with funding from the former commercial web
backup service provider Allmydata, but is now a stand-alone Open
Source\footnote{GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2} project
\cite{t_ars}.  It is written in the Python programming language with the Twisted
framework, and can run on Windows, Mac OSX, Linux, Solaris and more.

\subsection{Architecture}

Tahoe has a three layer architecture: the key-value store, the filesystem, and
the application.

The \textbf{key-value store}, or the ``capability-data bytes'' store, is the
lowest layer and is implemented by a grid of Tahoe-LAFS storage servers. Data is
kept on the storage servers in the form of ``shares'', which are encrypted and
encoded parts of files. Capabilities are short ASCII strings, containing
information on where to \emph{find} a file, and how to \emph{verify} it.
Nodes in the grid learn about each other through an ``introducer'', which
roughly relates to a tracker in the BitTorrent\footnote{See
\url{http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep\_0003.html}} protocol.

The \textbf{filesystem} layer is responsible for mapping human-meaningful
pathnames to pieces of data. Each directory contains a table of capabilities
for its children, i.e. subdirectories or files. Two forms of capabilities is
available for each file, read-only and read-write, and these can be shared to
provide shared/published directory structures with friends.

Since it is not practical for users to remember strings containing random
characters, the \textbf{application} layer is used for providing a user-friendly
interface to the directories and files.

\subsection{Related technologies}

Tahoe-\ac{LAFS} uses a number of techniques to realize the functionality
needed by a secure, distributed filesystem.

\paragraph{Erasure coding.}

When a client puts a file on the grid, it first encrypts the file, before
breaking the file into small segments. The segments are then \emph{erasure
coded}.  The use of the Solomon-Reed erasure coding scheme, enables Tahoe to
recover a file using only a predefined subset of the parts distributed to the
storage servers, i.e. the other nodes in the grid. Erasure coding is a type of
\ac{FEC} code, which extends a message with $C$ characters into a longer message
with $N$ symbols \cite{t_reed-solomon}.  The original $C$ characters can then be
recovered from a subset of the $N$ symbols.

The properties of erasure coding can be thought of as those of parity bits in
RAID\footnote{Redundant Array of Independent Disks} systems. \citet*{t_erasure}
compare erasure coding and plain replication, and conclude that ``\emph{...
erasure codes have mean time to failures many orders of magnitude higher than
replicated systems with similar storage and bandwidth requirements.}''

\paragraph{Merkle hash trees.}

%TODO: Describe hash trees in further detail?

\subsection{Use of secure hashes in Tahoe-LAFS}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{Tahoe-hashing.pdf}
    \caption{Tahoe-LAFS: Location of hashing}
    \label{fig:tahoehashing}
\end{figure}

As seen in figure \ref{fig:tahoehashing}, the usage of secure hashing is
extensive in Tahoe, and has to be considered as a key part of the functionality.


\section{Python bindings using Cython}
%What is it, how, why, alternatives?
% TODO: Hvorfor er nedenfornevnte i ASM eller C?
TAHOE-LAFS is written in python, but the SHA-3 candidate implementations found
in both the official NIST submissions and supercop are either in C or in
assembly. Therefore we need a way to make the implementations available in
Python. There a several ways to do this. Python itself includes a C-API,  
other options include SWIG, Cython and possible others.

\subsection{Python C-API}
The Python C-API is the official method of creating C-bindings for Python. The
procedure to do this includes writing entrypoints or wrappers for your C
functions in C. Then, through compiling you can acess your C-libraries and
functions through Python. The drawback with this approach, when faced with an
already existing C-library is that you have to actually write the
wrapper-functions or modify the C-library.

\subsection{Cython}
Cython tries to solve the problem of binding C-libraries and functions by the
use of Python instead of the use of C which the official API does. This is done
by only defining the entrypoints to the required C-functions and datatypes in a
Python/C/C++ hybrid syntax. Cython also allows creating new C/C++ functions,
available or not available to Python, in the same syntax. Cython works by
transforming the hybrid syntax into C/C++-code which utilises the official
Python C-API and compiling that. An expected tradeoff by using Cython is a
performance drop due to the extra layer of abstraction.
