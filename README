This project aims to test out the 14 second round candidates [0] of the NIST
SHA-3 secure hash competition with the Tahoe-LAFS [1] file system.

The python bindings will be written using Cython [2], unless we get the time to
write them using the Python-C API.

The Known Answer Tests (KATs) are retrieved from the official submissions [0],
and the C implementations of the algorithms are from SUPERCOP [3].
